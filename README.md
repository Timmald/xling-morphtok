This is where I will put code for my honors thesis.

My thesis focuses on evaluating the impact of morphologically-aware tokenization on LLM performance across languages with different morphologies.

I am currently pretraining 8 LLMs in 4 langauges, 4 with conventional BPE tokenization, and 4 with a custom morphologically-aware tokenizer.

I will begin pushing code soon, so stay tuned!
